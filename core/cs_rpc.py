"""RPC endpoint resolution: optional authenticated keys, verified public fallbacks.

Nothing here is required. Free public endpoints answer everything the sweep
needs for targeted work; an authenticated endpoint only helps when probing
thousands of addresses, where public nodes rate-limit.

The failure this module exists to prevent: a sweep once reported "no code" for
all 240 targets because `polygon-rpc.com` began answering HTTP 401 without an
API key. Every result was "unreachable", which looks exactly like a finding of
"nothing there" and is the worst possible kind of silent failure - a sweep that
appears to work and returns all zeros.

So: every fallback endpoint below is one that has been verified to answer
`eth_getCode` unauthenticated, and `scan_scope.py` treats a 100%-unreachable
sweep as an endpoint fault rather than a result.
