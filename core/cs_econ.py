"""Economic invariant checks for share-based vaults and AMM swaps.

`cs_veck` matches the *shape* of vulnerable code: a regex for `skim(`, a regex
for `totalSupply == 0`. That is the right tool for access control and the wrong
one here, because economic bugs live in the arithmetic, not the text. A vault can
contain every one of those strings and be perfectly safe, or omit all of them and
drain. The question is never "does this code look wrong" but "given these
numbers, does the attack make money".

So these functions are numerical models, not detectors. They take the vault's
share maths as an explicit callable and report numbers - attacker profit, victim
loss, per-cycle drift, sandwich margin - with the attacker paying real
consideration (deposit + donation, borrow, gas if given).

**Scope and honesty about scope.** These models are exact only for the maths they
are given. They do not read Solidity, and they do not prove anything about a
contract until you bind them to it: either by passing the vault's own conversion
functions, or with the Foundry harness in `tools/econ_harness/`, which runs the
same invariants against the deployed ABI. A model fed the wrong maths will
happily report a confidently wrong number, so every result is labelled with the
assumption it rests on.

The discrimination test is the point: `donation_attack` must report profit for a
vault with an empty-vault branch and no profit for one with virtual shares. If it
cannot tell those apart it is decoration, not a check.
