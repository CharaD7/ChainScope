"""Scan a contract tree for the 15 Critical-severity web3 vulnerability classes.

This exists because the classes below are what actually convert to a Critical
on Immunefi/Sherlock/Cantina: drain or insolvency, permanent lock, or
unrecoverable governance takeover. Anything short of that (gas waste,
temporary griefing, best practice) is not payable, so a triage that spends its
whole budget on low-severity hunting is wasted.

The scanner is a *triage aid, not an oracle*. Every hit is a prompt to read the
code and adjudicate; the output deliberately carries no severity, because a
regex cannot know whether a real exploit path exists. Several hits will be
false positives by construction (e.g. every proxy has an upgrade function).

Usage:
    python -m cli veck scan path/to/contracts --top 40
    python -m cli veck scan path/to/contracts --class 1 --class 6
    python -m cli veck list
    python -m cli veck checklist

    hit counts: scanning them can bury a real finding under thousands of hits from
    OpenZeppelin's own mocks, and it can equally make a target look clean because
    the match landed in a vendored copy rather than in first-party code.
