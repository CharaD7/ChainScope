"""Rank Immunefi bug-bounty programs by freshness, payout, and audit load.

This is the Immunefi counterpart to `cli/cs_hacken.py`. Immunefi has no
public JSON API, so the catalog and per-program metadata are recovered from the
React Server Component payload embedded in each program page.

    python -m cli immune list --min-bounty 100000 --top 20
    python -m cli immune list --fresh-scope --json
    python -m cli immune keizo --top 15
    python -m cli immune scope aera
    python -m cli immune triage aera --max-fetch 12

Immunefi differs from HackenProof in ways that shape the filters:
  * no reputation gate and no public report count, so those filters do not
    exist here (`keizo` re-weights the available signals accordingly);
  * `primacy` is `primacy_of_rules` (unlisted assets ineligible) or
    `primacy_of_impact` (broader), which materially changes what is worth
    hunting -- both are exposed;
  * every program publishes an `audits[]` array, which is the dedup surface
    most likely to make a finding ineligible. It is surfaced per program.
