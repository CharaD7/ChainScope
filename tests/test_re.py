"""Tests for the bytecode reverse-engineering engine.

Everything here runs offline against synthetic and captured bytecode. The network
paths (cast code, 4byte lookup) are not unit tested - a test that silently depends
on a mainnet RPC is a test that fails for reasons unrelated to the code, which is
how false signals get trusted.

The primitives are pinned because they are easy to get subtly wrong in ways that
look like findings:
  * opcode walking must skip PUSH payload, or payload bytes are read as opcodes
    and selector extraction returns nonsense;
  * slot 0x00 must render as 0x0, not the empty string after stripping zeros;
  * a minimal proxy carries its implementation in its runtime code;
  * interface inference must not fire on a single shared signature.
